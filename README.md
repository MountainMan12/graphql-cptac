# Data Consumption Journey using graphQL (Proof Of Concept)
  
### Running the application

- To install local dependencies, run the command : `npm install` (This has to be done during the initial setup)  
- To start the graphQL server, run the command : `npm run start`
- The application can be accessed on `https://localhost:4000/`


## Using data for the application

Currently, this branch does not provide direct access to any dataset.  

NOTE : For the purpose of this POC, we have not focussed on database management, and have used JSON documents to store the data.  

In order to use this application, we will create use-case specific branches, which will contain the data structured as per the Data Model.
